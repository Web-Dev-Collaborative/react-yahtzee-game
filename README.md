### What I learned

This was my first React project, which was a part of a course exercise. I've changed a couple of things from the original design. also I made it fully responsive. There were a lot of challenges for this project, on top of that since I wasn't really experinced those challenges doubled. However, I've learned a lot while building this project and I'm really happy how it turned out at the end. I've had a lot of fun both while building and while playing the app. I hope you like it too!
